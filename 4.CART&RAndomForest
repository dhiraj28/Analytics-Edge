we'll be discussing the application of analytics
into very different areas-- the Supreme Court
and health care cost prediction.
In the first lecture, we'll discuss
how the decisions of the United States Supreme Court
can be predicted before the case even gets to the court.
In the second lecture, we'll discuss the story
of D2Hawkeye, a medical data-mining company I have been
involved with for several years that
use analytics to gain an edge.
Through these examples, we'll introduce the method
of classification and regression trees, a very interpretable
analytics method.
