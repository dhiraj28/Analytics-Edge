predicting the baseball world series champion (OPTIONAL)

Last week, in the Moneyball lecture, we discussed how regular season performance is not strongly correlated with winning the World Series in baseball. In this homework question, we'll use the same data to investigate how well we can predict the World Series winner at the beginning of the playoffs.

To begin, load the dataset baseball.csv into R using the read.csv function, and call the data frame "baseball". This is the same data file we used during the Moneyball lecture, and the data comes from Baseball-Reference.com.
